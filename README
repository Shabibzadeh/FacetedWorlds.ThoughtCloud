An example of Correspondence. An out-of-browser Silverlight application
that stores data locally and synchronizes with a central service.

With this collaborative mind-mapping tool, you can share thought
clouds with other users. Any cloud you create on one machine is available
on any other machine. If you work with clouds off-line, they synchronize
the next time you connect.
